# rs_tfhe
Rust implementation of the TFHE Homomorphic Encrypted Computation Scheme

TFHE is an open-source library for fully homomorphic encryption, distributed under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.

## Platform Support

**x86_64 (Intel/AMD)**: Full support with SIMD-optimized FFT operations using AVX/FMA instructions. Recommended for maximum performance (3-5x faster than ARM64 for FFT operations).

**ARM64 (Apple Silicon/M-series)**: **Full support with 100% test pass rate!** Complete RustFFT-based negacyclic FFT implementation that passes all 28 tests. The library implements the exact same algorithm as x86_64 using pure Rust, with LLVM auto-vectorization leveraging NEON SIMD instructions for optimal ARM performance. All homomorphic operations work correctly including gates, bootstrapping, and key switching. Performance is ~3.5x slower than x86_64 AVX (~105ms vs ~30ms per gate), but all cryptographic operations are mathematically identical. **Production ready for Apple Silicon!**

**Other architectures**: Similar to ARM64 - full RustFFT support with correct negacyclic FFT implementation.

## Security Levels

The library supports **three security levels** to balance performance and security needs:

| Security Level | Feature Flag | Security Bits | Performance | Use Case |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **80-bit** | `--features security-80bit` | ~80 bits | **Fastest** (~20-30% faster) | Development, testing, low-security applications |
| **110-bit** | `--features security-110bit` | ~110 bits | **Balanced** | Original TFHE params, well-tested |
| **128-bit** | *(default)* | ~128 bits | **Baseline** | High security, production use (recommended) |

### Security Parameter Details

Each security level adjusts multiple cryptographic parameters:
- **LWE dimension (N)**: Higher = more secure, slower
- **Noise standard deviation (α)**: Balanced with dimension for security
- **Gadget decomposition levels (L)**: More levels = more secure, slower
- **Base bits (BGBIT)**: Smaller base = more levels needed

### Choosing a Security Level

```bash
# Default 128-bit security (recommended for production)
cargo build --release

# Fast 80-bit security (development/testing)
cargo build --release --features security-80bit

# Balanced 110-bit security (original TFHE)
cargo build --release --features security-110bit
```

**Security Considerations:**
- 80-bit: Adequate for short-term security, development environments
- 110-bit: Standard level from CGGI16/CGGI19 papers, well-tested
- 128-bit: Post-quantum secure with conservative margins, future-proof (DEFAULT)

All security levels have been validated against the LWE security estimator.

The underlying scheme is described in best paper of the IACR conference Asiacrypt 2016: “Faster fully homomorphic encryption: Bootstrapping in less than 0.1 seconds”, presented by Ilaria Chillotti, Nicolas Gama, Mariya Georgieva and Malika Izabachène.

rs_tfhe is a rust library which implements a very fast gate-by-gate bootstrapping, based on [CGGI16] and [CGGI17]. The library allows to evaluate an arbitrary boolean circuit composed of binary gates, over encrypted data, without revealing any information on the data.

The library supports the homomorphic evaluation of the 10 binary gates (And, Or, Xor, Nand, Nor, etc…), as well as the negation and the Mux gate. Performance varies by architecture:
- x86_64 with AVX/FMA: ~30ms per gate
- ARM64 with RustFFT+NEON: ~105ms per gate (both produce identical cryptographic results)

**NEON Optimizations:** The ARM64 build automatically uses NEON SIMD instructions via LLVM auto-vectorization when compiled with `target-cpu=native` (configured in `.cargo/config.toml`).

## Architecture

The library uses a **trait-based FFT processor design** for clean, maintainable code:

```
src/fft/
  ├── mod.rs                   - FFTProcessor trait definition
  ├── spqlios_fft.rs          - x86_64 SIMD (AVX/FMA assembly)
  └── rustfft_processor.rs    - ARM64/portable (pure Rust)

src/spqlios.rs                 - Compatibility wrapper (unified API)
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Compile-time backend selection (zero runtime overhead)
- ✅ Both implementations pass identical test suites
- ✅ Easy to add new backends (CUDA, WebAssembly, etc.)
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

The appropriate processor is automatically selected at compile time based on target architecture.

Unlike other libraries, the gate-bootstrapping mode of TFHE has no restriction on the number of gates or on their composition. This allows to perform any computation over encrypted data, even if the actual function that will be applied is not yet known when the data is encrypted. The library is easy to use with either manually crafted circuits, or with the output of automated circuit generation tools.

From the user point of view, the library can:

generate a secret-keyset and a cloud-keyset. The secret keyset is private, and provides encryption/decryption abilities. The cloud-keyset can be exported to the cloud, and allows to operate over encrypted data.
With the secret keyset, the library allows to encrypt and decrypt data. The encrypted data can safely be outsourced to the cloud, in order to perform secure homomorphic computations.
With the cloud-keyset, the library can evaluate a net-list of binary gates homomorphically at a rate of about 76 gates per second per core, without decrypting its input. It suffices to provide the sequence of gates, as well as ciphertexts of the input bits. And the library computes ciphertexts of the output bits.

# Build Instructions

## Building on x86_64 (Intel/AMD)

By default, the library enables SIMD-optimized FFT using FMA instructions:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

To use AVX instead of FMA:

```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features fft_avx,bootstrapping
```

## Building on ARM64 (Apple Silicon)

The library builds with full functionality using RustFFT with NEON optimizations:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

**NEON Optimizations**: The build automatically enables ARM NEON SIMD instructions via:
- `target-cpu=native` flag (configured in `.cargo/config.toml`)
- LLVM auto-vectorization of RustFFT operations
- Link-time optimization (LTO) for maximum performance

This provides ~5-10% performance improvement over generic ARM64 compilation.

All features work correctly! The implementation passes **all 28 unit tests** with 100% success rate.
